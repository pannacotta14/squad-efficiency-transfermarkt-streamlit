# Squad Efficiency — Transfermarkt - Dashboard

## Context

This repository contains the Streamlit dashboard developed as part of the HEC Lausanne Business Analytics group project.

The overall project studies squad efficiency in La Liga for the 2025-26 season, using Transfermarkt data to analyze how squad characteristics such as market value, age, availability, etc.

This repository corresponds to Role 3: Dashboard and web app development. Its purpose is to communicate analytical insights interactively to a non technical audience, building on the cleaned data and reusable functions produced in Roles 1 and 2.

## Objectives

The dashboard is designed to:

* Provide an intuitive, interactive interface to explore squad efficiency metrics
* Consume processed datasets and package functions produced upstream, avoiding duplicated logic
* Offer clear visual comparisons between teams at match and matchday level
* Follow reproducible and clean software engineering practices

The app focuses on interpretation and storytelling rather than data preparation or modeling.

## Dashboard structure

The Streamlit app is organized as a multi page application with two main analytical views.

### Dashboard 1, Matchday overview

This page provides a high level view of a selected LaLiga matchday.

Key elements include:

* Matchday selector
* Overview of all matches played on the selected matchday
* Visual comparison across teams to quickly identify outliers and patterns

### Dashboard 2, Match analysis

This page allows a deep dive into a single match.

Key elements include:

* Home and away team display with logos
* Match date and final score
* Side by side comparison of squad metrics for the two teams

The layout is inspired by comparison sections commonly found on football analytics platforms, while remaining simple and readable.

## Data inputs

This app does not perform scraping or heavy data cleaning.

It expects analysis ready datasets generated by the data pipeline developed in Role 1 and structured or exposed via reusable functions from Role 2. Typical inputs include:

* Match level data for the 2025-26 LaLiga season
* Squad level aggregates such as age and market value
* Team performance indicators from the league table

All data loading is cached to ensure good performance during interaction.

## Tech stack

* Python
* Streamlit for the web app
* Pandas for data handling

The app follows Streamlit best practices, including caching, modular code organization and a clear separation between UI and computation.

A typical structure for this repository is:

* .streamlit/
  Streamlit configuration files

* app.py
  Main entry point, acts as the portal and router for different pages

* pages/
  Streamlit pages for Homepage, Matchday Overview and Match Analysis

* core/
  Helper modules for data loading, layout components and visualizations

* data/
  Folder for processed data files consumed by the app

* assets/
  Static logo files for teams and league branding

* requirements.txt
  Python additional dependencies needed to run the app

This structure keeps the UI thin and delegates logic to testable modules where possible.
