For each match in the selected matchday, the dashboard displays competing teams with club identity and match result.
Each match is presented in a compact visual container so that several fixtures can be scanned at once without losing readability.

## Key interactions

This dashboard is best used as a filtering and orientation tool before moving to match level analysis, where individual team compositions and dynamics can be examined in more detail.

Users can:

* Select a specific matchday from the season
* Quickly identify matches of interest based on squad imbalance or unexpected results
* Navigate directly to the Match Analysis view for deeper inspection of a single fixture

The Matchday Overview acts as the main entry point to the dashboard workflow.
